# Probability Mapâ€“based Grape Detection and Counting
This repository is the official implementation of our paper: [PBECount: Prompt-Before-Extract Paradigm for Class-Agnostic Counting](https://temp), which is accepted by AAAI2025.

## Project setup
To setup our project on your own device, you need to download all the following files:
1. All the code in this repository, the 'PBECount' folder include the source code of our proposed PBECount method for CAC, and the 'FSC147_384_V2' folder include the code for ground truth data generation.
2. The [FSC147 dataset](https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/LearningToCountEverything).
3. Our [pretrained model weights](https://temp).
